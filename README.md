# windows-foreground-border
This AutoHotKey script creates a red border around whatever Windows app happens to be in the foreground. Not perfect and has some bugs, but works in general. I find this helpful when using speech input applications such as Dragon NaturallySpeaking, where the focused window is extremely important but rarely obvious.

The credit for this script should go to harrymc's answer in this [StackOverflow question](http://superuser.com/questions/723053/how-can-i-make-my-active-window-more-obvious-on-windows-7-without-disablng-trans/739332). I didn't really change it much, just customized some of the variables to fit my liking. 

Use this at your own risk. 

## Installation
Install AutoHotKey, then run the .ahk script (open with AutoHotKey if prompted). I would recommend putting it in your startup folder and it'll be invoked on login.

## Todo: 
	- Clean up script to be more configurable
	- Make feature toggle-able
